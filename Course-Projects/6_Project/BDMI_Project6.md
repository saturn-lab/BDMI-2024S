## **Topic selection, team formation, document submission, and deadline**

**Topic selection, team formation**

- Each topic chosen by the groups should be unique; each group should consist of 1-2 individuals.
- Group formation deadline: Before the 7th weekend (Nov 5). (List of registered participants)
- Topic selection deadline: Before the 10th week (Nov 26). (Submission of topics)

## **Assignment topic instructions**

**Special-topic (mandatory)**

Choose one from the following.

（1）Choose a problem in the field of deep learning or reinforcement learning and implement a solution (preferably integrating it with your own expertise).

I recommend everyone to explore existing problems and solution approaches on GitHub or Gitee. For instance, search for {computer vision, NLP, RL, GAN, etc.} on GitHub or Gitee, or refer to websites like [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota).

（2）Research a cutting-edge paper, including but not limited to: the latest developments in machine learning, recent applications of reinforcement learning, etc. If there is actual usable code available, it would be even better.

Reference links: [Google AI Research](https://ai.google.com), [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research), [OpenAI](https://openai.com), and more.

(If unsure, you can select a topic provided by the instructor).

（3）(Research on AI Product) Complete a course research report:
  Investigate a current or future AI product and analyze from multiple perspectives:
  (a) Application: Scope of application, target audience, and scenarios;
  (b) Implementation: Software, hardware, manufacturing process, materials, etc.;
  (c) Design thinking (product requirements, implementation);
  (d) Personal opinions and evaluations.
 
Homework Requirements:

Submit a WORD/PDF and PPT version. The WORD/PDF should be approximately 3000 words, concise but no specific length requirement. The PPT report should be 8-15 slides.

Include illustrations, images, and ensure proper citations for references.

(4) Challenging! (Participate in Quantitative Competition)

[AI Model Challenge](AI%20Model%20Invitational.md)
