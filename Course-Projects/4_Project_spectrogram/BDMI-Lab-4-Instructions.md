# Course Assignment 4-Instructions

## Group Organizational requirements

Each Group consists of 1-2 students;

* time requirement

Release time: 10/19 (the 5th week of the academic calendar)

Deadline: 12/03 (the 11th weekend of the university calendar) for class acceptance, and 12/17 to submit the report and complete code


## Misson description

###  data set 

Spectrogram data set (spectrogram dataset) of 24 voice commands. The speech spectrogram data set includes:

A vocal corpus data set of 40 people (/100 people) and a vocal verification data set of 20 people.

Spectrogram data set: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/a4cf25f158674baf88f7/

Test data set: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/bc80ac081ebf4c13befa/

Please download this data set by yourself.

### mission details

Classification of speech commands based on  spectrogram data set. On the output time-frequency spectrum diagram data set, the prediction results are generated by a deep neural network model designed by student themself.

**Several reference solutions for spectrogram classification using deep learning**

(1) Refer to classification process 1, reference link: https://tensorflow.google.cn/tutorials/images/classification (more convenient, recommended.)

(2) Refer to Classification Process 2, you can also refer to the link: https://tensorflow.google.cn/tutorials/load_data/images (You have also mastered the process of making tf.data data set!)

(3) Background supplementary: (Google simpleAudio) project link: https://tensorflow.google.cn/tutorials/audio/simple_audio
(Google TensorFlow officially provides a detailed case of classifying from speech files (*.wav) to time-frequency diagrams (spectrograms).) (You also mastered the production process from waveform files to time-frequency spectrograms!)

* hint:

Data augementation, resizing to standard size, etc. may be needed to solve the over-fitting problem. Reference link: https://tensorflow.google.cn/tutorials/images/data_augmentation

For the nueral network model, please refer to the audioNet project. Project web link: https://github.com/saturn-lab/audioNet



## Assignment submission and grading

- Experimental code  (notebook file that can be run successfully)
- Experimental report (list your innovation points and work content in design, as well as the analysis of the results)


**Grading**

In the 10th week of class inspection, each student will find the teacher for acceptance. The acceptance mainly depends on the code running and training process, and the accuracy indicators of the test set obtained by running the code will be recorded.

Once the acceptance check is completed, the assignment is qualified; additional scores can be obtained based on the experimental report and model accuracy.
