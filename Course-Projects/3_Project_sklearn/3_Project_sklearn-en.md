# Financial Data Forecast
# Data Predictive Analysis
## Background:
Predicting market price movements based on ML methods.

## Requirements:
At least three machine learning ML methods can be chosen, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Gaussian Classification, etc.

Data includes all data for four stocks, Guizhou Moutai (600519), Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750), WuXi AppTec (603259), and iFlytek (002230), from January 1, 2018, to April 1, 2020.

## Tips:
(1) Code should be organized with a sequential training-testing split, which can be done using the 'split' method.

(2) Predicting price rises and falls, assuming a profit for correct predictions and a loss for incorrect predictions.

(3) Win rate, or hit rate, is the ratio of profitable trades to the total number of trades. It should be greater than 50%.

## Submission Format:
Submit in a Word or Markdown document, with code in a *.ipynb file.
